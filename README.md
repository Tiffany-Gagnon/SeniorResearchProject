# SeniorResearchProject
 
## **Morality in Motion**

The main goal of this project will be to develop a simulation that tests the moral
choices that people would prefer to make in *trolley scenarios* when it comes
to autonomous driving. This was mainly inspired by past created experiments such as the 
**The Moral Machine experiment** and **CARLA** simulations. The scenarios created will 
also add the novelty of a survivability chance which is hypothesized to influence test 
subjects choices in scenarios. The scenarios will play out in real time and test subjects will have a 
short amount of time to react and choose whether to swerve or stay on course. Each 
choice will always result in a death of one or more characters in a scenario.
Scenarios will also test when people prefer to spare themselves versus sparing others.
Scenarios will replicate real life scenarios such as highway driving and parking
lot driving which will have varying survivability chances depending on the scenario.
At the end of a series of scenarios, data will be recorded and the test subject will
be informed of their preferences and statistics.
